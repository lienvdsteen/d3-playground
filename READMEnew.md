# d3-playground

This was a presentation I gave at Engagor for their development team during their weekly dev talk. 

It covers the very basics to start with [D3js](http://d3js.org/). You can clone the repository and just open 
`presentation.html` file to start the slide deck. The titles on the every slide are clickable and will open the
example that is being talked about on the slide.
