// we always begin by selecting a set of elements, even if you still have to create the elements
// this might be confusing (and it is confusing at first)
// but the reason we're doing this is:
// sometimes you're going to want to use rectangles that are currently there, by selecting all of them, you can:
    //  use them all
    //  select a few of them
    //  use them all and create more

// if you have many different rectangles, you can select on rect.class / ...
svg.selectAll("rect")
    .data(dataset)
    .enter() // creates placeholders for the missing rectangles for the datapoints
    .append("rect") // with append we add the missing rectangles
